Title: Produce a Scatter Plot
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Kyle",
           family = "Amaral",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "Kyle.Amaral@bcchr.ca")
Description: This package produces a quick plot of two numerical vairables. The graph that is produced by this function places the x parameter on the x-axis, and the y parameter on the y-axis. These variables are determined based on the dataframe that is defined as the data parameter. The graph that is produced will contain an alpha transparency of 0.3, and a linear regression line will also be placed on the graph. The limits of the graph will be expended to an origin of (0,0), and a classic theme has been applied.
